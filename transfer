 üéØ Direct GL Pricing Applications

  1. Industry Risk Segmentation & Classification

  - NAICS-Based Risk Tiers: Use the 103 industries to create detailed risk classification tiers
  - Granular Pricing: Move beyond broad categories to specific 4-digit/5-digit NAICS codes
  - Cross-Industry Benchmarking: Compare similar industries (e.g., different manufacturing subsectors)

  2. Exposure Base Development

  Premium = Rate √ó Exposure Base √ó Modification Factors
  Your data provides multiple exposure bases:
  - Payroll-based: Use employer counts and employment size data
  - Revenue-based: Leverage financial performance quartiles
  - Per-location: Use establishment counts by province

  3. Geographic Risk Assessment

  - Provincial Risk Differentials: Analyze claim frequencies by province using business density
  - Urban vs Rural: Compare metropolitan vs smaller provinces
  - Economic Concentration Risk: Identify provinces heavily dependent on high-risk industries

  üî¨ Advanced Analytical Approaches

  4. Business Size-Based Pricing Models

  # Risk often varies by business size
  Small Business (5-99 employees): Different GL exposure than
  Large Enterprise (500+ employees): Different risk profile
  - Size-Adjusted Rates: Micro/Small/Medium/Large business rate differentials
  - Scale Economics: Larger businesses may have better safety programs
  - Claims Severity: Small businesses may have less legal resources

  5. Financial Stability Indicators

  From your performance data:
  - Revenue Volatility: Industries with unstable revenue = higher GL risk
  - Profitability: Low-margin industries may cut safety spending
  - Quartile Analysis: Target profitable businesses (top quartile) with better rates

  6. Market Penetration Analysis

  Market Share Opportunity = Total Businesses - Current Insured
  - Underserved Markets: Identify industries/provinces with high business counts but low insurance penetration
  - Growth Opportunities: Focus on expanding industries (high employer growth)

  üìä Specific Research Methodologies

  7. Composite Risk Scoring

  Create weighted risk scores combining:
  Risk Score = (Industry Hazard Weight √ó 0.4) +
               (Business Size Factor √ó 0.3) +
               (Geographic Factor √ó 0.2) +
               (Financial Stability √ó 0.1)

  8. Predictive Loss Modeling

  Use your data as independent variables:
  - Business Density: Higher density = more third-party interactions
  - Industry Mix: Provinces with high-risk industry concentrations
  - Economic Indicators: Revenue growth as proxy for business activity

  9. Portfolio Optimization

  - Diversification Analysis: Ensure balanced exposure across industries/regions
  - Concentration Limits: Set maximum exposure limits by NAICS code
  - Rate Adequacy: Industries below profitability targets need rate increases

  üéØ Competitive Intelligence Applications

  10. Market Size Estimation

  Total Addressable Market = Œ£(Industry Businesses √ó Average Premium)
  - Premium Pool Calculation: Estimate total GL premiums by industry
  - Market Share Targets: Set realistic penetration goals
  - Competitive Positioning: Identify underserved niches

  11. Distribution Strategy

  - Agent/Broker Focus: Target provinces/industries with highest business concentrations
  - Digital vs Traditional: Small businesses (micro category) may prefer online
  - Industry-Specific Programs: Develop specialized programs for large industries

  üìà Enhanced Data Integration Ideas

  12. External Data Enhancement

  Combine your data with:
  - Claims Data: Map actual losses to industry/size/geography
  - Economic Data: GDP, employment trends, business formations
  - Regulatory Data: Workers' comp rates, safety regulations by province

  13. Dynamic Pricing Models

  - Real-Time Updates: Monitor business formation/closure trends
  - Economic Cycles: Adjust pricing based on industry performance quartiles
  - Seasonal Adjustments: Industries with seasonal employment patterns

  üîç Specific Research Questions Your Data Can Answer
